% CONMAN user interface
%   CONMAN modifies and extends the standard Prolog infer-
%   ence engine, providing the ability to use confidence
%   factors in reaching conclusions. As a result, we dis-
%   tinguish the procedures in CONMAN that handle communi-
%   cation with the user from the predicates that make up
%   the CONMAN inference engine.
%

%
% conman
%   Starts the consultation, calls the procedures making up
%   the inference engine, reports conclusions to the user, and
%   invokes the explanatory facility.
